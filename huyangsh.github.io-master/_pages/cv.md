### Education
--------------------
+ PhD student in Computer Science, Harvard University, 2022 ~ TBD.
  + I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/). I am also a member of [the Harvard Machine Learning Foundations Group](https://mlfoundations.org/).
+ B.E. in Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, 2018 ~ 2022.
  + I am a member of “Yao Class”, affiliated to the Institute of Interdisciplinary Information Sciences ([IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/)). <span style="font-size:14px;color:gray">"Yao Class" is founded by, and named after, the world-leading computer scientist and Turing Award winner [Prof. Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/). It attracts the most talented students in China who are interested in computer science. Learn more [here](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/). </span>
  + I am honored to graduate with *summa cum laude* (GPA: 3.96/4). My [senior thesis](/files/papers/2022B_senior_thesis.pdf) (advised by [Prof. Longbo Huang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/) and [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/); written in Chinese) receives the Excellent Senior Thesis Award, which studies performance analysis of model predictive control (MPC). I also receive multiple scholarships, including the National Scholarship for Undergraduates, First-class Scholarship at Tsinghua (in memory of Nanxiang Jiang), etc.
  + In my undergraduate years, I worked closely with [Prof. Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Prof. Guannan Qu](http://www.guannanqu.com/) on online control. Prior to that, my first research projects were advised by [Prof. Chongjie Zhang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhang/) and [Prof. Yang Yu](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/zh/yuy/). I would like to thank all of them for their efforts and help.
